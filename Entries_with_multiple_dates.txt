Some notes for Danuel

~63054 have exactly one date on the tape
~13500 have 2 or more dates on the tape

Of those ~13500, ~10000 have exactly two dates

Of those ~13500, ~7700 are back to back days in the first two dates listed
Of those ~13500, only ~750 are days that are more than a month apart

Because the dates are so close together when there are multiple dates,
I am going to ignore all but the first date listed on the analysis. For a handful (1%)
of the entries, the second date is over a month away from the first one, but
that doesn't feel like enough to overhaul the analysis at the moment.
